            <div class="bio">
                <p>Born into a family of reputed artists, Satyajit Ray (1921—1992) was a motion-film director, writer, 
                    illustrator and composer. Often touted as the figure that put Indian cinema on the world map, Ray 
                    earned eleven international prizes for his masterpiece “Pather Panchali”, including an honorary Oscar 
                    in 1992 for his contribution to cinema. He directed 36 independent films which included short films and 
                    documentaries. Besides films, Ray also wrote novels and short fiction predominantly for children and young 
                    adults. Among others, characters like Feluda, the skilful sleuth and Professor Shonku, the sharp-witted 
                    scientist are popular till date. The Government of India awarded him the Bharat Ratna – the highest civilian 
                    award in the country – shortly before his death.
                    <br>
                    Martin Scorsese described the work of Satyajit Ray as “treasures of cinema” that should be watched by “everyone 
                    with an interest in film”. The Japanese master Akira Kurosawa went further: “Not to have seen the cinema of Ray 
                    means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.”</p>
